# What is the keylogger?
**Keylogger** allows you to capture button clicks on the keyboard. Advanced keylogger can also take screenshots and send them immediately to Discord (to make it working you need to setup discord hook) when the victim types something on the keyboard. For the program to work properly, change the file extension from .py to .pyw to hide the console from user view
